#### Each attack defines the following: player movement towards locked, orbit info, timing, player and sword animation, projectiles

#ATTACK_FRAMES: frames (at 60fps) after release to be in attack state
ATTACK_FRAMES: 30
#COMBO_TIME: time after exiting attack state that if you attack it will continue the combo. Should be larger than time of hold for next attack in combo (MED_TIME for med, HEAVY_TIME for heavy)
COMBO_TIME: .6
# How many frames (at 60fps) the enemy stays in hitstun after being hit
HITSTUN_FRAMES: 10
# Triggers aerial state on hit
IS_LAUNCHER: false
# Whether this attack can break rocks
CAN_BREAK_ROCKS: false
# Damage multiplier for this attack
DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER: 1.0


ENTER_SOUND_EFFECT: "swing"
END_SOUND_EFFECT:


#What the player will do while in the attack
MOVEMENT_CONFIG:
  # Positive = toward locked enemy, negative = away
  PEAK_SPEED: 0
  # Proportion of attack time spent accelerating (0-1)
  ACCELERATION_PROPORTION: 0
  # Speed of deceleration after peak
  DECELERATION_SPEED: 0
  # Distance scaling: adjusts movement based on distance to the locked enemy.
  # Defines three zones measured from the enemy:
  #
  #   [0, NEAR)       NEAR zone — movement scales DOWN so the player doesn't overshoot.
  #                   Uses a power curve (slightly more aggressive than linear near the enemy).
  #   [NEAR, FAR]     Unaffected zone — full PEAK_SPEED, no scaling applied.
  #   (FAR, infinity) FAR zone — movement scales UP so the player closes the gap.
  #
  # Set NEAR to 0 to disable close-range scaling (unaffected extends to distance 0).
  # Set FAR to 0 to disable far-range scaling (unaffected extends to infinity).
  #
  # MULTIPLIER controls how much the player moves in scaled zones relative to the enemy distance:
  #   0.5 = player ends up roughly halfway to the enemy
  #   1.0 = player reaches the enemy
  #   2.0 = player overshoots by about the starting distance
  # Only affects NEAR and FAR zones; the unaffected zone always uses full PEAK_SPEED.
  DISTANCE_SCALE_NEAR: 10
  DISTANCE_SCALE_FAR: 0
  DISTANCE_SCALE_MULTIPLIER: 1
