  #SWAP or NORMAL. SWAP means that the item follows sword movement - it is at a 90 degree angle to the mouse and swaps when crossing the vertical axis. NORMAL is like the bow,
  #no 90 degree and it just orbits directly at the mouse.

  #Only will have an effect if ORBIT_TYPE = SWAP. This dictates how fast the orbit item (like the sword) mouse when attacking, since it usually swings from one side of the player
